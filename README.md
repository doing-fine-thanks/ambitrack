# Ambitrack - An Emergent Music System for Godot 4


Ambritrack is a loose sound-orchestration system (WIP) for coordinating various
samples among different game objects within Godot. Taking inspiration from 
tracker-like systems like the Amiga _Protracker_ or _Famitracker_, Ambitrack uses 
flat arrays of metadata to allow any game object to play or change audio samples
in a coordinated fashion. 

More to come!
